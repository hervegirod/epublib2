<h1>Epublib - a java epub library</h1>
<p>
Epublib is a java library for reading/writing epub files. It comes with both a viewer and a command-line tool.
It&#8217;s intended use is both as part of a larger java application and as a command-line tool.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Builtin viewer</dt>
<dd>
A viewer that supports table of contents, guide, meta info and pages.
</dd>

<dt>Comprehensive coverage of the epub standard </dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Has support for the spine, the table of contents and the guide.</li>
<li>Since the latest version it supports all the roles as defined in the Library of Congress relator list (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html">http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html</a>)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Simple things are simple</dt>
<dd>
<p>The api is designed to be as simple as possible, while at the same time making complex things possible too.</p>
<pre>
// read epub
EpubReader epubReader = new EpubReader();
Book book = epubReader.readEpub(new FileInputStream(&quot;mybook.epub&quot;));

// set title
book.getMetadata().setTitles(new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;() {{ add(&quot;an awesome book&quot;);}});

// write epub
EpubWriter epubWriter = new EpubWriter();
epubWriter.write(book, new FileOutputStream(&quot;mynewbook.epub&quot;));
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>Cleans up html into xhtml</dt>
<dd>Does not remove non-standard tags and attributes, but makes html files into valid xml (using xmlcleaner <a href="http://htmlcleaner.sourceforge.net/">http://htmlcleaner.sourceforge.net/</a>)</dd>
<dt>Cleans up non-standards compliant epub</dt>
<dd>
Epublib tries to be as forgiving as possible when reading epubs and writes them as standards-compliant as possible.<br />
If you&#8217;ve created an epub by zipping up several html files then running it through epub will make it much more standards-compliant.
</dd>
<dt>Fixes the coverpage on many readers</dt>
<dd>
For different epub readers the coverpage needs to be specified in a different way. Epublib tries several ways of extracting the coverpage from an existing epub and writes it in such a way that most (all the readers I&#8217;ve tested it on) display the coverpage correctly.</li>
</dd>
<dt>Support for creation of epubs</dt>
<dd>
The api supports the creation of epubs from scratch. See <a href="/epublib/example-programs/epub-sample-simple1">Creating a simple book example</a> for an example.</dd>
<dt>Convert (uncompressed) windows help (.chm)  files to epub</dt>
<dd>
After uncompressing a windows help file with something like <a href="http://www.jedrea.com/chmlib/">chmlib</a> epublib can make an epub file out of the resulting html and windows help index files.
